//I thought why not make a small precaution,prevent user from using a common password
//Inspired by github sign up form(thought it would be nice to implement it with small data that fits the criteria of password requirement(8 chars + 1 number+ 1 lowercase),but the actual list is way bigger),Here is the list of common passwords url:https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/..
